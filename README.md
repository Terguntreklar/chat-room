## What is this?
it's a (very) basic chat website with a singular chat room (but technically more can be created with small adjustments) messages are not encrypted also number of messages displayed is limited to 25

supports Google sign-in and anonymous messages, uses HTTP-API to create hashed and unique avatars, thanks to https://avatars.dicebear.com/

check out https://chat-room-efca6.web.app to try it!
please don't use profanity in the chat ðŸ˜¥
